<h2><i>Prelude</i>.</h2>

<p class="figcenter">
<img src="images/tb.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>

<p class="drop"><i><span class="uppercase">This</span> little book is cordially recommended
to all parties just hesitating on the plush-padded,
gilt-edged threshold of our highest social
circles.</i></p>

<p><i>In purely business affairs, it may not be as
useful as</i> Hoyle’s Games, <i>or</i> Locke on the
Human Understanding, <i>but a careful study of
its contents cannot but prove the “Open Sesame”
to that jealously-guarded realm,&mdash;good society,&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
which you aspire to circulate freely and shine
with becoming luster</i>.</p>

<p><i>“It is easier for a needle to pass through a
camel’s eye,” says Poor Richard, or some one else,
“than for a poor young man to enter the mansions
of the rich.” And I, the author of this
code of warnings, as truly say unto you, that a
contemptuous disregard of the same will be likely
to lead you into mortification and embarrassment,
if not into being incontinently kicked out of doors.</i></p>

<p><i>While intended chiefly for the young, not the
less may the old, the decrepit, and the infirm like-wise
rejoice in the possession of the rules and prohibitions
herein contained, and hasten to commit
them to memory.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p><i>But the memory is treacherous.</i></p>

<p><i>It would, therefore, be well for such persons
to carry the Hand Book constantly with them, to
be referred to on short notice wherever they may
chance to be&mdash;in the street-car, in the drawing-room,
on the promenade, on the ball-room floor, at
table, while visiting, and so on.</i></p>

<p><i>In this way the Hand Book will be like the
magic ring that pricked the wearer’s finger
warningly whenever about to yield to an unworthy
impulse. Its instructively reiterated
“Never” will become, indeed, a blessing&mdash;not in
disguise, but rather in guardian angel’s habiliments.</i></p>

<p><i>It will be, in truth, a bosom companion in the</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
<i>happiest sense of the term, a mutely eloquent
monitor of deportment, a still, small voice as to
what is in good form and what is not.</i></p>

Making and Receiving Calls.</h2>

<p class="hang">Never, however formal your visit, neglect
to wipe your feet on the door-mat, in
lieu of the hall or stair-carpet. A
private hall-way is not a stable entrance.</p>

<p class="hang">Never bound into the drawing-room unannounced,
with your hat, overcoat and
overshoes on, nor with your umbrella
in your hand, especially if it has been
raining hard.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never, particularly if a comparative
stranger, hail your host as “Old Cock,”
nor grab your hostess’s jeweled hand,
whether offered to you or not, as if it
were a rope’s end, and you in danger of
drowning. Neither, if other guests are
present with whom you have no acquaintance,
prance around amongst
them, poking them in the ribs, slapping
them on the back, etc. True breeding
is not synonymous with monkey capers
and bar-room manners.</p>

<p class="hang">Never be icy or contemptuous; but never,
on the other hand, be fiery or too
familiar. Emulate neither the iceberg
nor the volcano; there is a happy
medium that can be cultivated to advantage.</p>

<p class="hang">Never loll at full length on the sofa, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
bestride a chair with your elbows resting
on the back, and the soles of your
boots plainly visible to your <i>vis-a-vis</i>.
Sofas are not beds, nor are chairs vaulting-horses.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, even when sitting in your chair,
tilt it far back, with your heels resting
on the mantel-piece, and your back to
the rest of the company present. Are
you a gentleman or an orang-outang?</p>

<p class="hang">Never, either, keep twisting and squirming
about in your chair as if sitting on a
hornet’s nest, nor keep crossing and recrossing
the legs every second and a
half, nor carve your initials on the furniture
with your penknife. St. Vitus’
dance is one thing, dignified repose another.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never, in being introduced to a lady,
make a pun on her name, if it is a
homely one, or jokingly allude to rouge-pots
and whited sepulchers, if she is no
longer young, with an air of having resorted
to preservative aids. Illogical
but intuitive, the feminine mind is swift
to imagine and resent an innuendo where
perhaps none was intended.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if the lady be young but homely,
at once patronizingly remark that, after
all, handsome is as handsome does, and
you have even known the dowdiest and
most unattractive girls make good
matches through tact and perseverance.
However laudable your intention, there
may be a muscular brother inconveniently
in the background.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never attempt to sing or play, even though
pressed to do so, if you are absolutely
ignorant of both vocal and instrumental
music. Effects might, indeed, be produced,
but would they be desirable?</p>

<p class="hang">Never be so self-conscious as to fancy
yourself a cave-bear and other people
but field-mice. “True politeness will
betray no hoggishness,” as an ancient
writer has sagely observed.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, especially with your superiors,
buttonhole people, or shake your fist in
their faces, or pound them in the ribs
when you have occasion to address
them. This is more appropriate to a
horse auction than a drawing-room, and
is in violation of good form.</p>

<p class="hang">Never lean across one person with your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
hands on his knees and your back-hair
in his face, to talk to another.</p>

<p class="hang">Never bawl out at the top of your lungs,
or try to monopolize all the talk; you
are neither in the stock exchange nor a
cattle yard.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if bald and warm, mop and rub up
your head, ears and neck with your
handkerchief. A reception or drawing-room
is not a barber-shop.</p>

<p class="hang">Never intrude your maladies upon the
general conversation. People cannot be
so much interested in your bunions or
backache as you are.</p>

<p class="hang">Never violently abuse people who may
overhear you, nor be bitingly witty at
another’s expense.</p>

<p class="hang">Never interrupt the general conversation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
by reading long-winded newspaper reports
aloud.</p>

<p class="hang">Never contemptuously criticise the furniture,
the pictures, or the wall-paper as
being cheap and mean. This is but a
scurvy return for the hospitality you are
enjoying.</p>

<p class="hang">Never chew tobacco, or smoke a pipe at
receptions. If you must do the one or
the other, be sure to use the cuspidor;
but it is safer to let up on tobacco until
out-of-doors, or in your own room.</p>

<p class="hang">Never calumniate people, or give a false
coloring to your statements. In other
words, don’t lie any more than you can
help. Be diplomatic.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, above all, fail in tact. For instance,
don’t say that the room is as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
cold as a barn, even if you think so.
Tact and fact may not always go hand-in-hand.</p>

<p class="hang">Never interrupt or contradict overbearingly,
or with a sort of snort. Either
of these faults is directly opposed to
the canons of good society.</p>

<p class="hang">Never be explosive or pugnacious, accompanying
your side of an argument with
roaring explosives and furious gesticulations.
A lady’s parlor is not a bear-garden.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, on the other hand, be cowering
and sniveling, as though desirous of
some one to kick you as a boon. In
deportment, the demeanor of the rabbit
is no more to be emulated than that of
the famished wolf.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never, in the midst of a discussion upon
solemn topics, retail antediluvian jokes,
and then ha, ha! boisterously at them
when no one else can see anything to
laugh at. In fine, don’t be an unmitigated
bore.</p>

<p class="hang">Never gape, yawn, “heigh ho,” or stamp
your feet disapprovingly, when others
are talking. This is blighting, if not
fairly irritating.</p>

<p class="hang">Never be unduly “stuck up.” Because
you are yourself is no reason why you
are William H. Vanderbilt or George
Francis Train.</p>

<p class="hang">Never sulk and growl under your breath,
like a bear with a sore head, because
you fancy yourself neglected. Brighten
up, and even snicker, rather than adopt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
this gloomy course. Moroseness is dispiriting.</p>

<p class="hang">Never even murder a persistent bore
until you get outside. To send for the
police might cause an inconvenience.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if playing cards with ladies, spit on
your hands when dealing, or mark the
bowers and aces with pencil-marks or
knife-punctures. Englishmen would be
especially horrified at such a proceeding.</p>

<p class="hang">Never rave, tear your hair, or swear there
has been cheating all around, even if you
have lost ten cents on the game. Either
bear your losses with equanimity, or
never gamble.</p>

<p class="hang">Never treat aged and venerable persons
like budding hoodlums, or make riotous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
fun of their wrinkles or their bald heads.
You may be old yourself, some time, if
not assassinated for your bad manners.</p>

<p class="hang">Never neglect to give precedence to ladies,
both on entering and quitting a room.
A brutal disregard of this injunction
might cause you to be led out by the
ear.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, as hostess, insist that a casual
caller shall send for his trunk and stay
a week or two.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, as host, ask him hilariously if he is
well over his last drunk, and getting
primed for another. This is not in good
taste.</p>

<p class="hang">Never hurry your departure, as if your
legs were sticks and your body a sky-rocket.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never, on the other hand, tarry from, say,
four in the afternoon till three in the
morning. A light, flying visit is one
thing, taking root another.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

</p>

<h2 id="II">II.<br />

At Breakfast.</h2>

<p class="hang">Never descend to the breakfast-room
without having washed your face and
brushed your hair. Cleanliness is a part
of good breeding.</p>

<p class="hang">Never appear at breakfast, even in sultry
weather, without your coat, waistcoat,
collar and necktie. Are you a gentleman
or a Hottentot?</p>

<p class="hang">Never, even in winter, take your seat at
the table in your top-boots, with your
overcoat buttoned to the chin, and with
a sealskin cap drawn down to your eyebrows.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
But if you are breakfasting in
Franz Josef’s Land, this warning may
be disregarded.</p>

<p class="hang">Never fail to help the ladies first, before
gorging every edible in sight. You will
thus cultivate a reputation for self-abnegation
that may stand you in stead.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if a guest, inspect the butter suspiciously,
smelling and tasting it, and then
say, “Pretty good butter&mdash;what there
is of it!” Never, having perceived
your blunder, hasten to rectify it by
calling out, “Ay, and plenty of it, too&mdash;such
as it is! Ha, ha, ha!” Better abstain
from criticism altogether, since
nothing is costing you anything.</p>

<p class="hang">Never insist on starting this meal with
soup. <i>Cazuela</i>, or breakfast soup, is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Spanish-American custom that has not
yet been imported.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, before expressing your preference
for tea or coffee, ask your hostess which
she would recommend as the least
poisonous? She might not consider the
insinuation as complimentary to herself.</p>

<p class="hang">Never dispose of eggs by biting off the
small end, throwing the head far back,
and noisily sucking them out of the
shells. A spoon, or even a fork, is preferable.
Besides you might encounter
a bad one when too late.</p>

<p class="hang">Never wipe your nose on your napkin, or
use it in dusting off your boots on rising.
Napkins have their legitimate uses,
handkerchiefs theirs.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, on finishing with your napkin,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
fastidiously fold it away in its ring, nor
carelessly hang it on the chandelier.
Use judgment in little things.</p>

<p class="hang">Never cool your tea or coffee by pouring
it back and forth from cup to saucer and
from saucer to cup in a high arching
torrent, after the manner of a diamond-fastened
bar-tender with a cocktail or
julep. There’s a time and place for
everything.</p>

<p class="hang">Never suck your knife contemplatively,
and then dive it in the butter-dish. This
is wholly indefensible.</p>

<p class="hang">Never use the butter-knife in besmearing
and plastering your bread with butter
an inch thick. Better tear up the bread
in small chunks, and sop up the butter
with it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never cut meat with your teaspoon, sip
tea from a fork, or painfully suggest
sword-swallowing by eating with your
knife. Try to appear civilized.</p>

<p class="hang">Never convey the impression that you are
shoveling food down an excavation
rather than eating it. Cultivated people
eat, barbarians engulf.</p>

<p class="hang">Never smack the lips and roll the eyes
while masticating, accompanying the
operation with such expressions as,
“Oh, golly, but that’s good!” “Aha,
that touches the spot!” Give your
neighbors a show.</p>

<p class="hang">Never reach far over the table with both
hands for a coveted morsel. Ask for it,
call a servant, or circulate around the
table behind the other breakfasters’
chairs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never shake your fist at the waiters, or
swear at them in loud and imperious
tones. This is not the best form even
in a restaurant.</p>

<p class="hang">Never pounce on a particular morsel, intended
for an invalid, like a hawk on a
June-bug. First, say to yourself reflectively,
“Am I in a private breakfast-room
or a barn?”</p>

<p class="hang">Never try to dispose of beefsteak, peach-jam
and coffee at the same mouthful.
Failure, complete and ignominious, will
be the result.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if at a tenth-rate boarding-house,
insist upon having broiled game. In
the bright lexicon of the boarding-house
there’s no such word as quail.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, unless you are John L. Sullivan,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
indicate your irritation by upsetting the
table, or shying muffins at the landlord.
Equability of temper and a good appetite
should go hand in hand.</p>

<p class="hang">Never fail in urbanity with those around
you. Loud squabbling, fighting with
the feet under the table, and open rivalry
for the smiles of a pretty waitress are
altogether alien to the higher culture.</p>

<p class="hang">Never make a pretense, on quitting the
table, of mistaking the napkin for your
handkerchief. This is an old, old
dodge.</p>

<p class="hang">Never stretch yourself, gulch, gape and
yawp on rising. You should have finished
all that in bed.</p>

<p class="hang">Never refer to the meal you have disposed
of under the generic name of “hash.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
The commonness of this fault does not
excuse it.</p>

<p class="hang">Never fail in bowing gracefully when
abandoning the table, and, in lighting
your cigar, never strike a match on
your hostess’s back. Be keenly observant
of your well-bred neighbors, and
you will at last learn to avoid these
little breaches of etiquette that are so
painstakingly enumerated for your cultivation.</p>

At Luncheon.</h2>

<p class="hang">Never become notorious as that most unfortunate
and reprehensible of mortals&mdash;the
Lunch Fiend. If at a <i>pseudo</i>
free-lunch, drink something at the bar
first, if only a glass of water.</p>

<p class="hang">Never gorge at a luncheon, as if there
were never to be a dinner-hour. A
gentleman is never supposed to be ravenous.</p>

<p class="hang">Never indiscriminately mix your liquors
at this hour. A little whisky or brandy
as an appetizer, with not more than four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
varieties of wine while eating, and topping
off with a few mugs of beer, should
be quite satisfying.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if at a fashionable collation, discuss
business, politics or abstruse scientific
problems with the fair creatures present.
Sink the shop, if only for ten minutes.</p>

<p class="hang">Never jocosely give wrong names to well-known
dishes before you. To denominate
breaded cutlets “fried horse,” cold
corned beef “mule-meat,” and sliced
tongue “larded elephants’ ears,” may be
humorous, but hardly in keeping with
the light festivities of the occasion.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if ignorant of certain dishes, attempt
to denominate them at all. If
found palatable, eat and ask no questions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never fail to let a lady sip out of your
glass, if she entreats you to that effect.
You can secretly throw away the contents
afterward, but a direct insult was
not embodied in the request.</p>

<p class="hang">Never refuse to hold a lady’s saucer of
ice-cream for her, and feed her with a
spoon, at her earnest request. This
betrays a guileless trust in you that
should be esteemed as complimentary.</p>

<p class="hang">Never be detected in surreptitiously stuffing
your pockets with raisins, fruit-cake
and peanuts. It will not be so much
the theft as the detection that will cause
the honest blush to mantle in your virile
cheek.</p>

<p class="hang">Never attract a lady’s attention by playfully
signaling her across the table with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
melon-rinds or banana-peel. To trundle
a napkin-ring straight over into her
lap were in better taste.</p>

<p class="hang">Never regale the company with detailed
descriptions of similar repasts that you
have enjoyed in Pekin, but where puppy-dog
roasts, rat-pie and sharks’ fins were
the most appetizing features. Though
roars of laughter reward your recital,
you are not now in the antipodes.</p>

<p class="hang">Never give in in a contest over a favorite
turkey-bone with a spoiled child of the
family. Even if his howls shatter the
frescoes, never forget that you are his
senior, hence his superior.</p>

<p class="hang">Never feed your hostess’s favorite cat or
lap-dog at the lunch-table, by setting
the pretty creature on your shoulder,
and tossing up scraps to him between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
your own mouthfuls. This may be artless,
but is not in the best taste.</p>

<p class="hang">Never neglect to quit the table after all
the other guests have retired. To continue
gorging and guzzling in solitary
state is to make a show of yourself to
the menials.</p>

<p class="hang">Never fail, when you have at last fully
decided to give the repast a rest, to
quit the room easily, though with a dignified
air. To dance away with a hop,
skip and a jump, while trolling out “a
careless, careless tavern-catch,” or with
painful grimaces, while convulsively
clutching the pit of the stomach with
both hands, is to hint a reflection upon
the hospitality you have enjoyed. This
might subject you to unflattering comment.

<h2 id="IV">IV.<br />

At Dinner.</h2>

<p class="hang">Never forget that this is the repast <i>par
excellence</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, as an invited guest, be more than
two hours late. Your host and hostess,
as well as the other guests, may have
starved themselves for a fortnight for
this particular gorge.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, in handing in a lady, struggle desperately
to pass through the dining-room
doorway two abreast, if said aperture
admits but one at a time sidewise.
Even if it break your proud heart, give
the lady precedence always.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never sit six feet off from the table, nor
yet so crunched up against it as to
cause you indescribable torture. Well
within feeding distance, with ample
elbow-room for knife-and-fork play, is
your safest rule.</p>

<p class="hang">Never tuck your napkin all around under
your collar-band, nor make a child’s bib
of it. You are not in a barber’s chair
nor at a baby-farm.</p>

<p class="hang">Never suck up your soup with a straw,
nor, with your elbows on the table and
the plate-rim at your lips, drink it down
with happy gurgles and impetuous haste.
Go for it with a spoon for all you are
worth. Never ask for more than a
fourth service of soup.</p>

<p class="hang">Never bury your nose in your plate, while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
using your knife, fork and spoon at the
same time, after the manner of Chinese
chop-sticks. Maintain as erect an attitude
as you can without endangering
your spinal column, though not as if you
had swallowed a poker.</p>

<p class="hang">Never exhibit surprise or irritation, should
you overturn your soup in your lap.
Rise majestically, and while the waiter
is wiping it off, calmly declare that you
were born under a lucky star, since not
a drop has spattered your clothes.</p>

<p class="hang">Never snap off your bread in enormous
chunks, to be filtered and washed down
by gravy or wine. Rather than this,
crumb it off into pellets, to be skillfully
tossed into the mouth as occasion may
demand.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never ram your knife more than half-way
down your throat. Hack with your
knife, claw up with your fork; that is
what they’re made for. Never take up
a great meat-slice on your fork, and
then leisurely nibble around the corners,
making steady inroads till your teeth
strike silver. This is a method rigidly
interdicted among the highest circles.</p>

<p class="hang">Never eat fish with a spoon, if the silver
butter-knife can be appropriated for that
purpose.</p>

<p class="hang">Never eat as if you had bet high on getting
away with the entire banquet in six
minutes and a half. This may be complimentary
to the viands, but is somewhat
vulgar.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never, when the champagne begins to
circulate, snatch the bottle from the
waiter’s hand, hang on to the nozzle,
tilt up the butt, and ingurgitate for dear
life, while approvingly patting your
stomach with your disengaged hand.
This is little short of an enormity.</p>

<p class="hang">Never devour spinach with a mustard-spoon,
spear beans with a wooden tooth-pick,
or mistake the gravy for another
course of soup. Take your cue from
such of your neighbors as appear least
like hogs.</p>

<p class="hang">Never clean up and polish off your plate,
as if it were a magnifying lens, before
sending it for a second installment.
There are scullions in the kitchen, or
ought to be.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never spit back rejected morsels on your
plate, nor toss fruit-stones under the
table, nor hide fish-bones under the
ornamental center-pieces. An obdurate
piece of gristle should be bolted at all
hazards, fruit-stones may be dexterously
transferred to your neighbor’s plate, and
fish-bones may be cleverly utilized as a
garniture for the salt-cellars and butter-plates.</p>

<p class="hang">Never hurry matters when fully half-gorged,
when there is a ringing in your
ears, and things begin to swim before
your eyes. These are warnings to taper
off slowly, in preparation for dessert.</p>

<p class="hang">Never adhere wholly to champagne
throughout the repast. A few glasses
of claret as between-drinks, with now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
and then a quencher of brown sherry,
afford an agreeable variety.</p>

<p class="hang">Never forget to occasionally look after the
lady under your care. She may, moreover,
be useful in passing you dishes
during the temporary vanishings of the
servant.</p>

<p class="hang">Never attempt a flirtation, or even a sustained
conversation, during the repast.
Gastronomy is a noble but jealous mistress,
who permits no division of your
allegiance.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, when dessert is served, wade into
the jellies and riot amid the tarts and
cakes as if you were just getting up
your wind for a fresh onslaught. Be
moderate.</p>

<p class="hang">Never ask for a soup-plate of ice-cream.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
It is better form to have your saucer
replenished again and again.</p>

<p class="hang">Never talk when your mouth is fairly
crammed, nor in a smothered, wheezy
tone of voice. It is more dignified to
bow blandly, point to your mouth in explanation
of your predicament, and wag
your head.</p>

<p class="hang">Never be so pre-occupied with drinking as
not to be on the look-out for the lady
under your care. She has a right to her
share of the liquids.</p>

<p class="hang">Never be embarrassed. Retain your self-possession
if you are choking.</p>

<p class="hang">Never forget your own wants under any
circumstances. Remember that self-respect
is as much of a virtue as respect
for others.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never be self-conscious. Guzzle quietly,
and let others take care of themselves.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, on the other hand, push self-depreciation
to the wall. Never lose sight of
the fact that, while you are a gentleman,
you are also an American sovereign
feasting at some one else’s expense. All
sovereigns do that.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if called upon for a toast, be afraid
to pledge yourself. It you don’t blow
your own trumpet, who will blow it for
you?</p>

<p class="hang">Never use your fork for a tooth-pick, nor
the edge of the table-cloth for a napkin.
Summon a servant, and make known
your wants in imperious, stentorian
tones.</p>

<p class="hang">Never lounge back in your chair, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
request the waiter to pour wine down
your throat, if too unsteady to longer
hold a glass. This is apt to be noticeable.</p>

<p class="hang">Never rest both elbows on the table, while
shuffling your feet nervously underneath
it, and trying to steer one more glass to
your lips. If paralysis threatens, request
to be led out.</p>

<p class="hang">Never lose your temper. “When a man
has well-dined,” says an old playwright,
“he should feel in a good humor with
all the world.”</p>

<p class="hang">Never fail to rise when the ladies are
leaving the table, and to remain standing
somehow, no matter how unsteadily,
until the last petticoat has disappeared.
Then, your duty having been performed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
you can roll under the table, if you want
to, or see-saw back to your anchorage,
and see if you can hold any more wine.</p>

<p class="hang">Never drink too much wine. True, there
are a variety of opinions as to how
much is too much; but be prudent, be
resolved, never make an exhibition of
yourself, at least <i>try</i> to knock off before
being paralyzed, and be happy.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, however, yield to the jocular propensities
of your brother guests. Should
they prop you in a corner of the room,
with your hair drawn over your eyes
and a lamplighter in your mouth for a
cigar, and then jocosely vociferate
“Speech! speech!” heroically reach for
the nearest bottle, back with your head,
and guzzle away. A philosopher, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
real gentleman, will never be laughed
down, sneered under, or rubbed out.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if called on for a speech in a complimentary
way, however, make a
rostrum of the table at which you have
dined. Rather essay your own chair,
the window-sill, or even the mantel-piece.</p>

<p class="hang">Never fail in courtesy, even when grossly
intoxicated. Apologize, even if you
have slumbered on your neighbor’s
shoulder, and murmur your excuses even
while disappearing under the table. An
exponent of high breeding never forgets
to be a gentleman under the most adverse
circumstances.</p>

<p class="hang">Never whistle, sing ditties, or jeer irrelevantly
while another guest is responding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
to a popular toast. You surely should
not wish to monopolize the entire
oratorical effects of the occasion; and,
moreover, boorish interruption is always
in equivocal form.</p>

While Walking.</h2>

<p class="hang">Never fail to maintain a firm but easy
attitude. The willow, not the lightning-rod,
will afford you the best suggestions.</p>

<p class="hang">Never walk over people, but around them.
Men and women are not stepping-stones
or door-mats, save to monarchs and
rich corporations.</p>

<p class="hang">Never neglect to apologize if you stamp
on a man’s corns, or jostle him into an
excavation.</p>

<p class="hang">Never howl with laughter at any peculiarity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
of aspect, manner or dress. Be
a gentleman always.</p>

<p class="hang">Never crush and shoulder your way
through groups of ladies at shop-windows,
with your cane menacingly twirled
aloft, shillelah-fashion. Analogy between
a fashionable promenade and
Donnybrook Fair is wholly apocryphal.</p>

<p class="hang">Never smoke in the street, unless you can
afford a good article. Chinese cigarettes,
long nines, and black cutty pipes
are decidedly in bad form.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if you must smoke, whiffle your
smoke in others’ faces, or playfully burn
them in the back of the neck, or ask a
lady for a light. Walter Raleigh, the
father of tobacco-using, even carried his
own cuspidor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never munch nuts or gorge fruits in
public. A lady or gentleman on the
afternoon promenade, with a peeled
pineapple in one hand, a huge slice of
watermelon in the other, and the jaws
industriously working, is not an edifying
spectacle.</p>

<p class="hang">Never forget, if with a lady, that she is
under your protection, not you under
hers.</p>

<p class="hang">Never rush her past an oyster-saloon at a
run, or wildly distract her attention
from a confectioner’s window. As a
woman, she has her privileges.</p>

<p class="hang">Never drag her, pell-mell, with you through
a mob of fighting roughs.</p>

<p class="hang">Never forget to be kind, even while feigning
deafness to all insinuations as to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
refreshment. “Kindness iz an instinkt,”
says Josh Billings, “while politeness iz
only an art.”</p>

<p class="hang">Never neglect to give her at least a portion
of your umbrella, when escorting
her through the rain. If it should rain
cats and dogs, as the saying goes, an
adjournment beneath an awning, or
front-stoop, might be deemed advisable.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if walking with a tramp, introduce
him to every acquaintance you chance
to meet. It is a free country, but the
line must be drawn somewhere.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if you have occasion to address a
strange lady, scrape, cringe and wriggle
before her in an agony of politeness.
To raise your hat gravely, place your
hand on your heart, and yield her a low,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
sweeping obeisance, with your shoulders
shrugged considerably higher than your
ears, is sufficient. You are not supposed
to be a Corean ambassador in
the presence of Jay Gould.</p>

<p class="hang">Never address questions to strangers indiscriminately,
especially as to their
secret and private affairs. Communicativeness
is not a necessary outcome of a
total lack of sodality.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, even in questioning a policeman,
fan him with his own club, note down
his number, and ask him if he has yet
got the hair off his teeth. Though in
livery, he may yet be above the brute
creation.</p>

<p class="hang">Never ask questions at all, but consult
this Hand Book.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never, if suddenly confronted on the
promenade by a hostile acquaintance,
accept his proposition to fight him in
the gutter for a pot of beer. You are
not a Prize Fighter.</p>

<p class="hang">Never forget to pick up a lady’s handkerchief,
if she lets it fall by accident; not
with effusive familiarity, but daintily on
the end of your cane or umbrella. Common
civility is one of the cardinal points
of good breeding.</p>

<p class="hang">Never pick it up at all, if she drops it purposely.
You needn’t set your foot on
it, or scowl at her; but coquetry is one
of the vices deserving of silent reproof.</p>

<p class="hang">Never pick up anything that even your
companion may drop, unless he should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
be very drunk. You may pick him up
also, if he should drop.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, even if in haste, rush through a
crowded thoroughfare at a breakneck
gait, with your hair flying, your necktie
over your ears, and shouting “Clear the
track!” at every jump. Hire a cab, or
obtain roller-skates. Repose of manner
should never be sacrificed to emotional
insanity.</p>

<p class="hang">Never pose on street corners, attitudinize
before show-case mirrors, or
whistle an opera bouffe air while
watching a funeral cortege.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if with a lady, ask her to wait for
you on the curb while you step into an
adjacent bar-room to see a man. The
ruse is a transparent one, and, moreover,
she may be thirsty herself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never hilariously address a stranger with
an obvious defect of vision as “Squinty,”
nor ask another how many barrels of
whisky it has taken to paint his nose.
Such familiarities may possibly be resented.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, on the other hand, be so over-civil
as to be mistaken for a dancing
master or a bunco-steerer.</p>

<p class="hang">Never forget that a gentleman is a gentleman
everywhere. Even McGilder was
occasionally taken for one.</p>

<p class="hang">Never have your shoes polished in the
middle of the sidewalk while hanging
on to an awning-beam for support. It
may create the impression that all the
polish you have is upon your shoes.

In the Use of Language.</h2>

<p class="hang">Never cease trying to make yourself understood.
Learn to read and write
before you are of age.</p>

<p class="hang">Never pronounce with your teeth clenched,
through the nose, or by ripping up the
sounds laboriously from the pit of the
stomach. Speak gently, but with
clarion-like distinctness.</p>

<p class="hang">Never squeal like a rat, grunt like a pig,
or roar like a bull. Cultivate a pleasing
voice.</p>

<p class="hang">Never smother your meaning out of sight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
with slang. “Soup should be seasoned,
not red-hot,” says an old writer.</p>

<p class="hang">Never swear, anathematize, or fairly drip
with profanity, especially in the presence
of delicate ladies and small children.
Undue emphasis often defeats itself.</p>

<p class="hang">Never indicate a mere passing surprise by
such expressions as “Holy smoke!”
“Gosh almighty!” “I’m teetotally
dashed!” and the like. A mere lifting
of the eyebrows, a convulsive gasp, or a
wild, staggered look, while smiting the
forehead with the fist, will be demonstrative
enough.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say <i>sir</i> to a bootblack and <i>old chap</i>
to a minister of the gospel in the same
breath. Exercise tact.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say “No, mum” or “Yessum,” in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
addressing a lady, or “Not much, old
hoss,” or “yezzur,” in speaking to a
gentleman, even if these chance to be
your parents or near relatives. “No,
dad,” “Yes, mommy,” “No, granny,”
“Yes, nunksy,” and so on, are more
affectionate.</p>

<p class="hang">Never address a young lady as <i>Jen.</i>, <i>Mol.</i>,
<i>Pol.</i>, <i>Bet.</i>, <i>Suke.</i>, or by any other abbreviation
of her given name. <i>Miss So-and-so</i>,
or plain <i>miss</i>, is in better form.</p>

<p class="hang">Never address a young married lady as
<i>old girl</i>, even if you were intimate with
her before her marriage. Her husband
may not apprehend your facetiousness.</p>

<p class="hang">Never mispronounce. Never say <i>purtect</i>
for <i>protect</i>, <i>yer</i> for <i>you</i>, <i>tater</i> for <i>potato</i>,
<i>this ’ere</i> for <i>this here</i>, <i>tommytoes</i> for <i>tomatoes</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
<i>voilent</i> for <i>violent</i>, <i>aborgoyne</i> for
<i>aborigine</i>, or <i>busted</i> for <i>bursted</i>. “Take
her up tenderly, lift her with care.”</p>

<p class="hang">Never say <i>kin</i> for <i>can</i>, <i>they’se</i> for <i>they’re</i>,
<i>feller</i> for <i>fellow</i>, <i>gal</i> for <i>girl</i>, <i>wuz</i> for <i>was</i>,
<i>whar</i> for <i>where</i>, <i>thar</i> for <i>there</i>, <i>har</i> for
<i>hair</i>, <i>hev</i> for <i>have</i>, <i>wull</i> for <i>will</i>, <i>cud</i> for
<i>could</i>, nor <i>wud</i> for <i>would</i>. Never
imagine that ignoramuses only fall into
these errors. The greatest scholars in
the world have been known to fairly
revel in them when suffering from
<i>delirium tremens</i>, or otherwise off their
guard.</p>

<p class="hang">Never forget that <i>duty</i> rhymes with <i>beauty</i>,
not with <i>booty</i>, and that <i>morn</i> doesn’t
rhyme with <i>dawn</i> at all&mdash;poetasters to
the contrary notwithstanding. Even a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
gentleman of the world will not wholly
despise the soft demands of rhythm.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say <i>idear</i> for <i>idea</i>, nor <i>wahm</i> for
<i>warm</i>. The addition of the <i>r</i> in the one
case is as indefensible as its omission in
the other.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say <i>pants</i> for <i>trousers</i>, <i>vest</i> for <i>waistcoat</i>,
<i>boiled rag</i> for <i>shirt</i>, nor <i>trotter cases</i>
for <i>boots</i> and <i>shoes</i>. As a sole alternative,
let your language be choice to
fastidiousness.</p>

<p class="hang">Never allude to a <i>cuss</i>, meaning a <i>man</i>.
Even <i>pure cussedness</i> for <i>sheer contrariety</i>
is becoming the property of the common
herd.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say “the old woman,” alluding to
your wife. Is marriage of necessity
the grave of respect?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never speak of your father as “the
governor,” “the old man,” “the money-bag,”
and the like. Perhaps, he is a
very good sort of person.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say <i>castor</i> for hat, nor <i>gun-boats</i> for
<i>overshoes</i>, nor <i>duds</i> for <i>clothes</i> in general.
A multiplication of these synonyms may
be creditable to the invention, but is
apt to be confusing.</p>

<p class="hang">Never fear to say you are <i>sick</i>, if you are
so. Englishmen are <i>h’ill</i>, and Frenchmen
are at liberty to be <i>indispos&eacute;</i>. We
never say “an ill room,” or “an indisposed
bed,” but “a sick room” or “a
sick bed,” as the case may be.</p>

<p class="hang">Never ask if the railroad has come in, but
if the train has come in. The track can
no more come and go than can the
station itself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never pile on the adjectives. A painting
may be meritorious without being
“stunning;” a handsome wall-paper is
not necessarily “excruciating;” and
you should hardly call a choice dish
of ham and eggs “divine.” Let not
your enthusiasm overleap itself.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say <i>naw</i>, <i>nixy</i>, <i>not by a blamed sight</i>,
nor <i>nary a time</i>, for pure and simple <i>no</i>.
Let the negative be swift, clear and
decisive, even in declining a drink.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say <i>yis</i>, <i>yaw</i> nor <i>ya-as</i>, for <i>yes</i>,
unless you swear by the shamrock, the
Bologna sausage, or the roast beef of
old England.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say that you believe you’ll take
root or come to anchor, when you intend
sitting down, nor say “squatty-vous”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
to a friend in requesting him to
take a seat.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if you must use slang, fail to make
a judicious choice of it. Who was it
said, “Let me but make the slang of a
people, and he who will make their
laws?” But no matter; since there is
plenty of it ready-made. Never attempt
to add thereto, but be content to separate
the wheat from the chaff, the fine
gold from the dross.</p>

<p class="hang">Never speak of a bar-room as “a h’istery,”
“a whisky ranch,” “a rum-hole,” or “a
jig-water dispensary.” Plain old Anglo-Saxon
“gin-mill” must hold its own
against the innovations of storming
time.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, in speaking confidentially to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
young lady of her father’s tippling
habits, refer to him as “an old soaker,”
“a rum-head,” “a guzzler,” “a perambulating
beer-keg,” or “a happy-go-lucky
old swill-tub.” Far better to slur matters
gently by recommending an inebriate
asylum, or suggesting that the old
gentleman be locked up with a whisky-barrel,
with a fair chance of his drinking
himself to death.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, at social gatherings, speak of
elderly ladies as “old hens,” nor of the
children of the house as “kids.” But
a careful study of the very best society
will soon make these pitfalls apparent
to you.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, in entreating a young lady to sing,
ask her if she can’t chirp or twitter a bit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never, after she has sung, and with obvious
effort, playfully suggest that she
has a bellows to mend. To gaze into
her eyes lingeringly, and whisper that
you did not mean to knock her endwise,
would be more considerate and soothing.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say, <i>smeller</i>, <i>horn</i>, <i>bugle</i>, or <i>snoot</i>
for <i>nose</i>. Never say <i>peepers</i> for <i>eyes</i>,
<i>potato-trap</i> for <i>mouth</i>, nor <i>bread-basket</i>
for <i>stomach</i>, at least not in the very
highest circles. <i>Olfactor</i>, <i>optics</i> and
<i>paunch</i> are a choice disguise for the
Queen’s English, if that is the end in
view.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say that a man was “howling mad”
or “jumping crazy,” meaning that he
was very angry, when you have such
tempting morsels as “hopping mad,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
“frothing at the mouth,” “mad as a
hatter,” and “crazy as a bedbug” at
your disposal.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say, “Well, I should smile,” meaning
that you assent to something said
or proposed, when honest old “You can
bet your boots I will” is coyly nestling
near at hand, craving a caress.</p>

<p class="hang">Never ask, “How in &mdash;&mdash; am I going to
do it?” when silvery “Do it youself,
and be blowed!” may lend a mingled
suavity and conciseness to the situation.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say, “busted in the snoot” for
“thumped in the proboscis.” This is
wholly inexcusable.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say “I <i>seed</i>” for “I <i>saw</i>,” “I <i>heerd</i>”
for “I <i>heard</i>,” or “I <i>thunk</i>” for “I
<i>thought</i>.” Notwithstanding that these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
gross mistakes may be in vogue among
highly-educated men, newspaper editors
and professional linguists, erect a standard
of your own rather than follow in
their unworthy lead.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say, “Him an’ me is goin’ to the
circus,” when “He and I <i>are</i> going to
the circus” is meant. This scarcely
perceptible inaccuracy brings many a
conscientious student to grief.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say, “They is well, but I are not.”
Painstaking discernment will enable you
to make the correction.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say “Between you and I and the
pump-handle,” meaning “Between you
and me.”</p>

<p class="hang">Never speak of dinner as “grub,” “hash”
or “trough-time,” nor refer to the dessert
as “an after-clap.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never, if you have been on a spree, allude
to it as a “boose,” a “toot,” a “twist,”
a “rolling big drunk,” a “bust,” or a
“bump,” when strong, sensible “budge,”
“bender” and “jamboree” are peeping
wistfully from the catalogue.</p>

<p class="hang">Never proclaim that you are “chocked to
the throat,” meaning simply that you
have dined plentifully.</p>

<p class="hang">Never be afraid to call a spade a “spade,”
even if you have bet on hearts or diamonds.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if intoxicated, say that you are
“weaving the winding way,” “slopping
over,” “six sheets in the wind,” or
“screwed.” The latter is wholly British,
and not yet adopted with us.</p>

<p class="hang">Never repeat worn-out saws and proverbs,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
such as “It’s a long turn that makes no
lane,” “It’s an ill wind that blows your
hat off,” and the like. Better use your
own invention than harp forever on a
moldered string.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, moreover, repeat much-used quotations,
no matter how celebrated they
may once have been. “We have met
the enemy and we are theirs,” and
“Whoever undertakes to shoot down
the American flag, haul him on the
spot,” may be patriotic, but they weary,
they weary!</p>

<p class="hang">Never call a pretender a “cad,” when
either “fraud” or “dead-beat” can
safely give odds to the importation.</p>

<p class="hang">Never allude to your time-piece as a
“cracker,” a “turnip” or a “ticker,” nor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
to your hands as “mawlies,” “fins” or
“flippers,” nor to your fingers as
“digits.” The use of any one of these
slang terms indicates a want of higher
culture.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, in referring to an enemy, say that
you will “put a head on him bigger
than a bushel-basket,” merely meaning
that you will punch him.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say “peart” for clever.</p>

<p class="hang">Never say <i>oncommon</i> for <i>uncommon</i>, nor
comment upon a delicacy by saying
that it is “licking good.”</p>

<p class="hang">Never say, in commenting upon a lady’s
appearance, that she looked like a
“fright,” like a “frump,” or like “a
bundle of bones tied up with rags.”
You have “dowdy” and “scarecrow”
to fall back on.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never wish aloud that a man may be
hanged, drawn and quartered, simply
because he owes you a dollar and a
quarter. Fiendish resentment is not
one of the shining characteristics of a
true gentleman.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, when in doubt as to any particular
form of expression, fail to consult this
Hand Book. It is the one faithful
lamp by which your steps may be
guided.</p>

Dress and Personal Habits.</h2>

<p class="hang">Never forget to wash yourself and brush
your hair (if you have any) before
quitting your room in the morning.
To make your toilet at the kitchen sink,
or even at a convenient fire-plug, is to
set the canons of good society at
naught.</p>

<p class="hang">Never re-appear in the morning with a
dirty shirt, a crushed hat, and with your
necktie under your ear. This might
convey the impression that you had
gone to bed in your clothes.</p>

<p class="hang">Never be filthy in anything. Cleanliness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
is a virtue that even a recognized
gentleman cannot afford to hold in
contempt.</p>

<p class="hang">Never appear in other than subdued
colors, for the most part. “Give me
plain red and yellow,” said the negro
minister, in his advice to his flock on
the vanities of dress.</p>

<p class="hang">Never wear anything over-dainty. Never&mdash;of
course, we are now addressing the
male reader, for whom this invaluable
Hand Book is chiefly designed&mdash;wear
anything that the gentler sex have made
exclusively their own. To appear in
public with a nosegay in lieu of a
throat-stud, or even with a sunflower at
the waist, would be likely to excite
remark.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never wear check-shirts, children’s dickies,
nor ’longshoremen’s jumpers. An immaculate
shirt-front with a clean collar
to match, is always <i>en r&egrave;gle</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">Never wear full evening dress in the
early morning, especially if you intend
working in the garden, or whitewashing
the back fence, before going down town.</p>

<p class="hang">Never wear dancing pumps in rainy or
snowy weather, or arctics if it is warm
and fine. But long-continued observation
will finally enable you to discriminate
for yourself in these minor matters.</p>

<p class="hang">Never appear among ladies with your
boots covered with mud, and your whole
person suggestive of having been rolled
in the gutter. If you haven’t a servant
or wife to clean you up, undertake the
task yourself, however distasteful.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never wear your hat tilted far over your
nose, with a cigar meeting its brim at a
rising angle of forty-five degrees from
your lips. The Volunteer Fire Department,
though once the arbiter of manly
deportment, is a thing of the past.</p>

<p class="hang">Never wear pinchbeck jewelry, loud breast-pins,
nor steel, silver or washed-gold
watch-guards. Secret-society regalia,
conspicuously worn, and multitudinous
finger-rings are also in questionable
taste.</p>

<p class="hang">Never walk with a high-and-mighty stud-horse
gait, nor yet slouch and slink
along as if you had robbed a hen-roost,
nor yet with a bounding hoop-la sort of
prance, like a clown in the circus-ring.
Never, either, walk bow-legged or club-footed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
if you can help it. Cultivate a
grand, regal, easy and flowing carriage,
but without swagger or bombast.</p>

<p class="hang">Never walk, especially if in haste, with
your arms folded, nor with your hands
in your coat-tail pockets.</p>

<p class="hang">Never improvise tooth-picks out of fence
splints, and then chew them industriously
in public. Tobacco and chewing-gum
still assert their claims.</p>

<p class="hang">Never expectorate all around you at every
step you take, without an instant’s intermission.
If you are troubled with
bronchitis, remain at home. If the
same old drunk persistently lingers, try
a B. and S., or a gin fizz, according to
your judgment.</p>

<p class="hang">Never whistle like a locomotive, nor attempt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
a Tyrolese <i>jodel</i>, while walking
with a lady or ladies on a fashionable
promenade.</p>

<p class="hang">Never whittle sticks, play on a jewsharp,
or essay to catch flies on window-panes
in public. Such recreations, innocent
in themselves, should only be pursued
in the privacy of one’s own apartment.</p>

<p class="hang">Never permit the quality or cut of your
wearing-apparel to deteriorate, if you
have to live on pork and beans to keep
up your end in this regard. “Never
retrench in your wardrobe expenses,
whatever you do,” said old Samuel
Pepys. “All the world knows how you
appear, but no one need know how you
live.” A frequent change of residence
might serve to disconcert the tailors,
should they prove troublesome.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p class="hang">Never allow your shoes to run down at the
heel, nor out at the toes. Nothing is
more incongruous than a fine gentleman,
in other respects quite the swell, with
his foot-leather burst out around the
instep, his stocking heels wabbling up
and down at every jump, and his bare
toes courting the public gaze.</p>

<p class="hang">Never hiccough or sneeze without intermission,
unless greatly inebriated. In
this dilemma, lose no time in drinking
yourself sober, or in seeking temporary
retirement, if only on a park-bench.</p>

<p class="hang">Never let your lower lip hang down on
your breast, like a motherless calf’s.
“Put up or shut up,” says the Coptic
proverb.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, on the other hand, screw up your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
lips under your nose, as though constantly
subjected to an overpowering
odor. Even a prevailing ecstatic, attar-of-roses
haunted expression is in preferable
form to this.</p>

<p class="hang">Never fail to keep your nose clean. If
you have no handkerchief, use your
coat-tail.</p>

<p class="hang">Never cultivate a broad, teeth-husking
smile, unless your ivories are in good
order. Tobacco-stained fangs are at an
especial disadvantage in this form.</p>

<p class="hang">Never fail to cleanse the teeth at least
once a week. A tooth-brush is best.</p>

<p class="hang">Never wear your hat in church, in a
boudoir, nor at a marriage or burial
service; never, on the other hand, take
it off when overtaken by a blizzard or a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
cyclone. If neither the blizzard nor
the cyclone does that much for you,
you may consider yourself fortunate.</p>

<p class="hang">Never doff your hat nor make your bow
indiscriminately. A Cyrus Field, for
instance, would be justified in expecting
greater courtesy than would be accorded
to a Jesse James; though, if cornered
by one of the latter type on his own
stamping-ground, it would doubtless be
well not to slight him too conspicuously.
Be diplomatic.</p>

<p class="hang">Never fail to cultivate an off-hand judgment
of men and women who are
strangers to you. A man with a head
like a monkey’s is not necessarily a
savant; nor are putty-like faces, with
idiotic lips and China-blue eyes, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
women, necessarily Elizabeth Cady
Stantonesque in intellectual scope and
oratorical brilliancy. You would scarcely
mistake Red Leary for Herbert Spencer.</p>

<p class="hang">Never carry a lighted cigar into a millinery
store or powder-magazine.</p>

<p class="hang">Never be over servile to good clothes for
themselves alone. The professional
thief who lost his life in a double tragedy
in Sixth avenue not long ago, was one
of the best dressed men in New York.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, on the other hand venture to
indiscriminately despise slovenly dress
in men or women. Lady Burdette-Coutts
is said to occasionally slouch
around London like a charwoman just
for the fun of the thing; good old
Steve Girard was wont to dress like a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
music-master in distress; and some
greasy, old, garlic-smelling tatterdemalion
at your elbow may be one of
the most successful pawnbrokers of the
Hebraic persuasion.</p>

<p class="hang">Never burst, without notice, into any one’s
private apartment like a shot out of a
gun. Even your excuse that you want
to borrow your car-fare may not be
mollifying, and people have nerves.</p>

<p class="hang">Never keep gnawing your mustache,
twisting your whiskers into fantastic
braids, nor making your hat wag about
on your head through muscular contraction
of the scalp.</p>

<p class="hang">Never crackle your knuckles with sharp
reports, grit your teeth, heave deep,
wheezing sighs, nor keep running your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
fingers through your hair till it stands
up like a brush-heap. If you imagine
one or all of these feats to be uniquely
interesting, hire out to a dime museum.</p>

<p class="hang">Never take any more drinks in the early
part of the day than are absolutely
necessary to brace you up. Three
cocktails as eye-openers, followed by
two in the way of appetizers, ought to
straighten you up before breakfast,
and, if not already a slave to tippling,
a dozen beers or so ought to satisfy you
between then and noon. If tempted to
overdo the matter, recall the wax group
of the Drunkard’s Family in Barnum’s
old museum, set the teeth hard, and
shut down, shut down!</p>

<p class="hang">Never forget to say your prayers before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
going to sleep, if it is in accordance
with your religious Convictions.</p>

<p class="hang">Never fail to have convictions of some
sort. A man without any is like a cat
shelling walnuts. Would you be a non-entity,
a dolt, a jackass, or a gentleman
of distinction, a man of parts, a power
in the land?</p>

At Public Entertainments.</h2>

<p class="hang">Never, if escorting one lady or several,
scuffle and bandy oaths with ticket-speculators
at a theater-entrance. Cultivate
an easy <i>hauteur</i> of manner.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, under like environments, offer to
bounce the attendant policeman, boots,
blue-coat and buttons, if he will only
drop his club. Your ladies may object,
if the policeman does not.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, upon entering, seize an usher by
the throat, rub your coupons into his
eyes, and loudly demand your seats or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
his life. A public entertainment is not
a rat-baiting.</p>

<p class="hang">Never retain your hat and take off your
coat and waistcoat at theater or opera.
To shed the tile and retain the garments
is in better form.</p>

<p class="hang">Never whistle, guffaw or make boisterous
comments during the rendition of pathetic
scenes. Consistency’s a jewel.</p>

<p class="hang">Never testify your approbation by prolonged
roars, cries of “Hear, hear!”
tossing your hat in the air, and making
quartz-crushers of your feet. Moderate
your transports.</p>

<p class="hang">Never express your disapproval by furious
catcalls, by pelting the performers with
stale eggs, or by vociferated injunctions
to “choke ’em off,” to “burn the crib,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
or to “run down the rag.” A pronounced
sibilation, accompanied by
judicious barkings, will answer quite as
well.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, even if slowly murdered by the
orchestra, betray your sufferings by
idiotic grimaces, violent contortions and
dismal groans. Remember Talleyrand,
who could have smiled his unconsciousness
even if stabbed in the back.</p>

<p class="hang">Never jocosely shout out “Fire!” if a red-haired
lady should rustle into a seat in
front of you. Incendiarism is the legitimate
mission of stump-orators and fire-bugs.</p>

<p class="hang">Never bring your opera-glass to bear like
a siege-gun, with your lips spread open
as over a Barmecides free-lunch. Even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
a harsh gritting of the teeth, during the
operation, is not in the best taste.</p>

<p class="hang">Never hold it for a lady to look through,
while adjusting her line of vision by the
back of her head, and advising her in a
hoarse whisper as to the best method
for “gunning” her object. Are you at
the opera or the race-course?</p>

<p class="hang">Never loudly discuss politics, divorce suits
or ministerial scandals at the theater or
at a concert when the performance is
going on. If speech is silver and silence
golden, discussion at such times is
metallic to annoyance.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if compelled to quit the building
before the entertainment is finished,
pass up the aisle on all fours, to avoid
an interruption. Siamese obsequiousness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
is out of place in well-bred audiences.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, at the close, hump your way
boorishly through the well-dressed
throngs, or expedite an exit by flying
leaps over the backs of the seats. Even
a break over the stage would be preferable
to this form.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, after a brief adjournment to the
open air, apologize to the lady under
your escort with a profuseness that will
render the cloves, burned coffee or
smoked herring too apparent on your
breath. Better confess at once to a gin-sour,
and be done with it. Frankness
and rankness rhyme but in materiality
where truth is at stake.</p>

<p class="hang">Never send flowers to the stage in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
market-basket, or bombard a <i>diva</i> with
bouquets bigger than a cooking-stove.
The language of flowers should appeal
to the inner sense.</p>

<p class="hang">Never enter a crowded auditorium with
your thumbs in the arm-holes of your
waistcoat, head thrown back, chin in
air, and the stub of a cigar between the
teeth. Self-consciousness may be pushed
to an extreme.</p>

<p class="hang">Never lunch between acts, in full view of
audience, on cheap sandwiches, peanuts
and ginger-beer, even if you have missed
your supper. Secretly tighten your
waist-band, and think of Baron Trenck
and his fortitude in prison.</p>

<p class="hang">Never blow your nose with a loud trumpeting
during an especially interesting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
scene, or while a difficult aria is being
sung. A fanfare is not necessarily in
sympathy with a <i>tremolo</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, if with a lady, individualize the
features of a ballet. A grinning reticence
in this regard is more delicate.</p>

<p class="hang">Never attempt to join in with the chorus,
even at a negro minstrel show. Even
burnt-cork has its privileges.</p>

<p class="hang">Never permit a lady to pay for the tickets
at the box-office. If you havn’t any
money, don’t go.</p>

<p class="hang">Never, on seeing a lady home, hint that
ice-cream and oyster-saloons are dangerous
places at night, the common resorts
of tramps, thieves, prize-fighters and
penniless adventurers. Veracity is one
of the characteristics of high breeding.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
